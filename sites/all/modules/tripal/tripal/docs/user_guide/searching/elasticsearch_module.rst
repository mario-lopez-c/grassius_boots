Tripal Elasticsearch Module
========================================


Tripal Elasticsearch is an extension module created by the `Staton Lab <https://github.com/statonlab>`_ at the University of Tennessee that integrates the `Elasticsearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>`_ search engine with Tripal sites. By enabling the module, you are provided with a set of tools to index and search your Tripal 3 or Tripal 2 site. It provides an easy to set up site wide search and gene search blocks out of the box. Tripal Elasticsearch also provides support for Cross-site querying, which allows users to search multiple websites in a fast and asynchronous manner in one query.

To enable Tripal Elasticsearch on your site, you must install an Elasticsearch instance, enable the Tripal Elasticsearch module, and use it to index your siteâ€™s data. For documentation on how to install and configure Tripal Elasticsearch, please `visit the Github repository <https://github.com/tripal/tripal_elasticsearch>`_.
