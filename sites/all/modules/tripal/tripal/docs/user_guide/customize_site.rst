Customizing Your Site
=====================

Through the combination of Drupal, Chado and the Tripal API, it is possible to fully customize your site and to add new functionality.  Tripal does not store or display all data out-of-the box, and every site has its own different look-and-feel.  If you want greater functionality beyond what comes with Tripal please see the :doc:`Developer's Handbook </dev_guide>` for instructions to use the Drupal and Tripal APIs to develop your own extensions to Tripal.
