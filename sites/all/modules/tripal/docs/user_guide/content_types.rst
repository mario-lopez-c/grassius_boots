Working with Content Types
==========================

New in Tripal v3 is the ability to create your own content types and manage their display!  In previous versions of Tripal a bit of PHP programming was necessary. This is no longer the case.  Tripal v3 comes pre-populated with a variety of content types and provides a web interface that allows you to create your own.  This section provides details for working with content types in Tripal.
